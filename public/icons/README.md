# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for your Chrome Extension:

-  icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
-  icon32.png (32x32 pixels)
-  icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
-  icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editor or online icon generator.
The icons should represent your seller automation extension with clear, recognizable symbols.

For now, you can use placeholder icons or generate them using:

-  Figma
-  Canva
-  Online favicon generators
-  AI image generators

Make sure all icons have a transparent background and are optimized for web use.
