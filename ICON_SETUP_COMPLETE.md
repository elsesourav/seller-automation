## 🚀 **Ready to use:**

## 💡 **Note:**

Chrome extensions typically need multiple icon sizes for different contexts. Since you have one icon file, I've used it for all sizes. For best results, consider creating optimized versions:

-  16x16px for small displays
-  32x32px for medium displays
-  48x48px for larger displays
-  128x128px for high-resolution displays

Your extension now has proper branding with your icon appearing everywhere it should! 🎉
